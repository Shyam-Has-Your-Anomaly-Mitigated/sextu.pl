=head1 text-based user interfaces

the command-line is (usually) a single line; usually [A] "there is one line (DOTADIW)", but there can be "multiple lines"; either [B] "multiple lines, doing the same thing", or [C] "multiple lines, doing different things"...I'm most interested in C (A âˆ§ B are trivial)

the console is everything else; the canvas/dimension/reality

the terminal is the universal set (set theory)

the interface is either free-cursor, cursor-free (KDE), or multi-cursor; either "multiple cursors, doing the same thing", or "multiple cursors, doing different things"...keyboard-driven environments are superior
