goto L<scripting|https://www.open.edu.au/courses/it/rmit-university-scripting-language-programming--cpt223-2017> assignments; checksum injection...this time, gotta crack 'Ã©m all! :D

inject checksum at nth line

C<inject($file, $line, $algorithm)>

needs the C<$checksum> value (from C<key_rng()> depending on C<$algorithm>? make it parametrically optional) ...is dependant on C<$algorithm>

needs a C<$format> string

maybe also C<rinjectx($file, $regex, $algorithm)>

=head4 checksum()

C<checksum($file, $algorithm)>

=head4 _()

modulated algorithms
